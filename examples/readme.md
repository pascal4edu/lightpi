All examples have been created and tested with Lazarus (FreePascal). To run each example, simply load and compile each ***lpr project file***.

# calculator
Many interpreter projects start out as "how can I execute a math formula?". When implemented correctly one will end up with a lexer, parser, etc. This example shows a very simple way on how to use LPI for exactly that: execute math formulas.

# cardgame
This was the original inspiration for the creation of LPI. How to manage card effects or consumable items in a game? Hardcoding every effect / feature didn't look like a good option. Wouldn't it be better to store and execute small scripts for each card or item? That's exactly what happens in this example!

# ide
Interacting with an interpreter in realtime is the best way to explore new ideas, scripts and also learn more about this project. The entered code is automatically executed and can also be displayed as debug output with each interpreter stage visible! It can be quite mesmerizing to see your code getting transformed into an abstract syntax tree. Give it a try!

# plotter
Why stop at a calculator? Simply assign the entered formula to a variable and run the script with different inputs for x. Read the result back and you have a plotter.

# web server scripting
How hard can it be to write a "dumb" web server and add pascal like scripting to it? Let's find out in this example.
